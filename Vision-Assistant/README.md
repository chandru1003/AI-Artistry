# Vision Assistant

# Project Description:

 Vision Assistant is an interactive application that utilizes the power of the Gemini Vision API model to generate unique and insightful outputs based on user-provided images and prompts. With this application, users can upload an image and input a prompt of their choice, and the Gemini Vision API model will generate relevant and creative responses, offering a new perspective on the uploaded image.



# Environment Setup:

- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
```bash 
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the Application:
- Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the project directory (vision-assistant).
Run the Streamlit application:
```bash 
streamlit run main.py
```
# Interacting with the Application:

- Upon launching the application, you'll be presented with the  Vision Assistant interface.
- Input your prompt or query in the provided text box.
- Optionally, enhance your query by uploading an image relevant to your prompt.
- Click the "Generate" button to let the Gemini Vision AI model create a contextual and visually appealing output based on your input.

# Usage Guide:

- **Prompt Input:** Enter your query or prompt in the text box. This could be a sentence, phrase, or question to guide the generative process.

- **Upload Image (Optional):** Click the "Choose an image..." button to upload an image that complements your prompt or enhances the generative process. Supported image formats include JPG, JPEG, and PNG.

- **Output Generation:** Click the "Generate" button to initiate the generation process. The Gemini Vision AI model will use your prompt and the uploaded image (if provided) to create a unique and contextually relevant output.

- **View Output:** The application will display the generated output, showcasing the creativity and contextual understanding of the Gemini Vision AI model. Explore different prompts and images to witness the diversity of generated content.
